BlockUnlock
===========

A rapid reflex iOS game that tricks the user into learning boolean logic.

Blue is ON, Red is OFF, X is XOR, | is OR, + is AND. Tap on the operator you would like to use and then tap on the empty gate to place it there. You can see in touchesBegan and touchesEnded the beginnings of a throwing gesture for more intuitive control.
